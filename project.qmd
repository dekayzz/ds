The #ProjectDS initiative is a fantastic way to hone your data science skills, especially in the R ecosystem. The project encourages the use of tools in the tidyverse like ggplot2, tidyr, and dplyr, but it's open to any code-based methodology. This makes it an excellent playground for both R and Python enthusiasts.

While I regularly participate in weekly, these posts highlight my favorite submissions and the corresponding code.
